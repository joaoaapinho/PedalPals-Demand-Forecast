<h3 align="center">PedalPals: Bike Sharing Demand Forecasting</h3>

<p align="center"><b>Done by:</b> João André Pinho</p>

<h2> 👁‍🗨 Overview </h2>

PedalPals, a fictious Dutch bike-sharing company, is considering expanding into the US market. To make an informed decision, PedalPals' Machine Learning and AI Engineering Team proposed estimating the demand for bike rentals in Q4 of 2012 using an acquired dataset on the US bike-sharing scene. 

- Problem Definition
**"Can PedalPals reliably forecast Q4 2012 shared bike demand in the US to decide whether to enter the market during that period?"**

The goal is to forecast if the total market number of rides for that quarter is projected to exceed 300,000, from which PedalPals aims to capture 5% market share immediately upon expansion. The purchased dataset contains a comprehensive collection of bike sharing data points from 2011 and an estimation for the first three quarters of 2012 that captures a variety of characteristics that impact bike utilization.
